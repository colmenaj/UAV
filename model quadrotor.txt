model of quadrotor

introduction
inertia moments
skew symmetric matrix
rotation matrix and deduction or obtention
properties of rotation matrix
composition of rotations
change of coordinates & change of coordinates caused by rotation matrix
derivative of rotation matrix
euler angles and cardan angles (dangle= (B_ang)*w)  
derivative over a system with coordinates in a rotating system (dr=dr+wxr with r in mobile system)
drag torque (cause of drag torque)

Developpement
free body diagram
deduction of equations: attitude and position


conclusion
non linearities: flexible wings, inaccurate gravity center, speed force relationship in motors, variation of inertia moments
